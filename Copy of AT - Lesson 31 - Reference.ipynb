Wherever you see the hat (**^**) sign on the heading of activity, give a hats-off to the student at the end of the activity.\n","\n","    - Single hat sign, i.e., **^** denotes give hats-off for concentration. You have to assess the concentration level of a student based on their attentiveness and understanding of the concept.\n","\n","    - Double hat signs, i.e., **^^** denotes give hats-off for creativity.

Every time you execute your code in the Google Colab notebook, please don't forget to save it by pressing the **Ctrl + S** keys (or **Command + S** keys if you are using a Mac).

Occasionally, you may encounter some error such as `NameError, ReferenceError, ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` after executing the code in $k^{th}$ code cell (where $k > 0$). Most likely, due to poor internet speed, the Colab notebook might have lost the information that all the previous codes have been executed already. As a remedy, run codes in the code cells beginning from the first code cell till the $(k - 1)^{th}$ code cell. For e.g., if the code in the $5^{th}$ code cell fails to run because of one of the aforementioned errors, execute the codes in all the first four code cells again.\n","\n","10.
