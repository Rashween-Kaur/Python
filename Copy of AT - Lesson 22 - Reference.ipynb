Wherever you see the hat (**^**) sign on the heading of activity, give a hats-off to the student at the end of the activity.\n","\n","    - Single hat sign, i.e., **^** denotes give hats-off for concentration. You have to assess the concentration level of a student based on their attentiveness and understanding of the concept.\n","\n","    - Double hat signs, i.e., **^^** denotes give hats-off for creativity. It can be an alternative approach to writing a code for an activity or applying the logic in a totally different problem statement.\n","\n","    - Triple hat signs, i.e., **^^^** denotes give hats-off for persistence.

Every time you execute your code in the Google Colab notebook, please don't forget to save it by pressing the **Ctrl + S** keys (or **Command + S** keys if you are using a Mac).

Most likely, due to poor internet speed, the Colab notebook might have lost the information that all the previous codes have been executed already.

For e.g., if the code in the\n","$5^{th}$\n","code cell fails to run because of one of the aforementioned errors, execute the codes in all the first four code cells again.\n","\n","11.
