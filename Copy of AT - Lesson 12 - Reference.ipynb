The computer looks for certain patterns in the player inputs (`Heads` or `Tails`) and tries to remember them. Furthermore, it assumes that the player will follow these patterns the next time if the same situation arises.\n","\n","2. If an assumed pattern is not repeated at least twice by the player, the machine predicts `Heads` or `Tails` randomly.\n","\n","The types of patterns remembered, involve the outcome of two successive plays, i.e., whether or not the player won on those plays and whether the player changed their choice between the plays and after the plays.\n","\n","There are 8 possible situations and, for each situation, a player can do two things. These 8 situations are:\n","\n","1. The player **wins**, plays the **same** and **wins** again. The player then plays the same or plays differently.\n","\n","2. The player **wins**, plays the **same** and **loses**. The player then plays the same or plays differently.\n","\n","3. The player **wins**, plays **differently** and **wins** again.
